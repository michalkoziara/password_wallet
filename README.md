# Password Wallet

### A mobile application for managing passwords

The goal of this project is to create a mobile application for Android that allows users to store and manage their passwords in encrypted form.

The application supports HMAC and SHA-512 encryption algorithms. 
The application uses algorithm implementations provided by the [Pointy Castle package](https://pub.dev/packages/pointycastle), which is based on implementations from [the Bouncy Castle](https://bouncycastle.org/).

[BloC library](https://bloclibrary.dev/), by Felix Angelov, is used to manage application state.

Application code coverage is measured by LCOV and is 90.4%.
